name: Cheat Code Submission Readme
about: Read this first before your submit your cheat codes

---

Did you create the cheat code or you're only sharing it? Please specify it to avoid confusion. Also, do not forget to include the **Version** and **Type**! If you don't specify the version then I'll just assume it's for the base version which is 1.00. If no type is specified then I won't add your cheat code in the database until you specify it in the issue comments.	

## Testing tour Cheat Codes ##

Before you submit your cheat code you have to test it in this condition:

1. Close the game's bubble to restart the game then test your codes 
2. Do a full shutdown of your PSVita by holding the power button then test your codes

If cheat code doesn't work after doing all the steps then the game have DMA. Read the following pointer code tutorials:
